#Ideas for this project.

= This page is a short summery about project ideas.=

*1) DSL and back testing mechanism in Lua.*
     A good example will be FXCM Indicore SDK. They have connected Lua 5.1 with their C API and made a nice interface available
     to traders. Lua is a powerful language to write and test strategies quickly even for non-professionals.
     Integrating lua with a broker or OMS interface will be a good project idea. 


*2) Complex chart pattern analysis using Prolog.*
      Although there is lot of fuss going on over algorithmic trading and its criticality of "speed", many are forgetting that 
      next biggest thing in this industry is "smartness" not speed in picosends as some claim. After initial introduction with
      prolog I was too impressed with its capability and its potential usages in making a thinking machine which can think 
      like trader.   
      

*3) Complex Event Processing for logically complicated strategies.
      I think only way of automating real time thought process is a new technology called "Complex Event Processing" which
      mostly works like human thought process. A lot thing can be done in this.
      
*4) Statistical analysis in Haskell.
      Since introduction to haskell, I fell in love of this language for its cuteness and power. Although I don't know at this 
      point, how I will be able to use it in this profession, I will still try everything in it.
      
*5) Snippates/ Pseudo codes for important and frequently used parts in trading algos.  
      This is one of the frequently faced problem for new programmers, trader or non trader. Some logic in this industry is so
      strange, that I want to make a library of few functions flow which should help new progremmers to grasp the basic building 
      blocks quickly.
      
*6) Self modifying algo with meta programming.
      This is one of my dream to write a program where logic will mutate along with condition of the market.
      
    
*7) Use of Prolog as simple rule engine.
