#Here I will try to explain ease, and benefit of Lua scripting language as trading DSL .

= Introduction =

*[http://www.lua.org Lua]* scripting language, which is actively used in game programming for its ease of integration with other languages, and ease of programming has bright future in algorithmic trading industry. We will take example of [http://fxcodebase.com FXCodeBase] and lay down a workable design of a independent open source trading engine. In this document we will explore possibility of integrating Lua as a trading scripting engine and discuss about platform architecture. *This document is still in phase of primary drafting.* 

This draft is expected to unfold in following sequence.

* Introduction to Lua and benefit of it as trading scripting engine.

* Study of FXCODEBASE architecture and what more can be added.
