#Application of Complex Event Processing in Algorithmic Trading.

# Introduction #

Algorithmic trading is, in short, processing real time market data under a trading logic and generating automated buy and sell signal. Risk management, position management and state management is part of Algorithmic trading software implementation. If trading is not based on large mathematical calculations, but on complex logic based of time(temporal) and various events happening over the time then using Complex Event Processing is best way to go. In A slim CEP engine, actions happens over reactive mode with state of various events saved in runtime memory, hence collecting and saving large amount of data is not required.

In this ongoing study project, we will explain various hard learned tips and tricks of application of complex event processing in Algorithmic Trading.

During this study we will explore 7 CEP engines and do a comparative study for ease of implementing simple and complex strategies.

**Drools Fusion (Jboss Drools Family, Rule Based)**

**ESPER (Open Source, SQL based)**

**Sybase Aleri (SAP, SQL based)**

**StreamBase (SQL Based)**

**Oracle CEP (SQL Based**

**and If possible Progress Apama (Rule Based)**
