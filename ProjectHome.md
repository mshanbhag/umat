This project is part of my learning and experiments in application of unconventional methods in algorithmic trading of financial markets.

This project has following 5 purposes. This may change along with development of project. Because this is actually an exploration in unknown jungle, it is bound to change.

1) Learning different programming languages which may be helpful in my future career.

2) Experimenting different unconventional approaches in algorithmic trading which are not allowed to do/ thought as waste of time at my workplace.

3) Learn about strength and weakness of programming languages by making something in all languages and weighting its benefits and weakness for that particular thing.

4) Make online friends who are in exactly same situation as me and share experience/ Learn from theirs.

5) Doing all unconventional things which are not permitted in workplaces.

Although I am in trading domain since last 10 years, my biggest weakness has been lack of production level programming skills. This year I have decided to be proficient in programming skills.

My journey and its experience will be helpful for those who are in a finance business domain and learning programming skills for domain specific application purpose(It may not help fresher wanting to start career in finance or trading). I have plan to publish all my learning codes as open source once completed, and write a open source book something like "Learning programming for traders from scratch".
