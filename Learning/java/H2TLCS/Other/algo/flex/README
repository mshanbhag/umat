How to run Flex dashboard demo:

To Setup:
---------

This dashboard demo is hardcoded to receive information from streams in the supplied
Finance/AlgorithmicTrading example. In order for it to work, the Sybase CEP Server
must be set up on localhost, port 6789.  The AlgorithmicTrading project must be 
loaded in the 'Default' workspace and then started.

To check whether everything is set up as expected by the Flex dashboard application, 
check the Properties Tab in Sybase CEP Studio for StreamSummary stream while the program is 
running. The http url for the stream should be as follows:

    http://localhost:6789/Stream/Default/AlgorithmicTrading/CplQp/StreamSummary_1


To Run:
-------

To start the Flash program. 


Open the Flash file in the browser of choice by navigating to 

    file://C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\My Documents\SybaseC8Repository\<version>\examples\Finance\AlgorithmicTrading\flex\bin\Dash1.swf

Four graphs should appear with a label at the bottom of the area with the security 
settings for the Flash file.

In FlashPlayer 8 and 9, Adobe introduced a new security model that uses the notion of 
sandboxes that limit what resources Flash can access when executing. In order for this 
demo to run, the security model has to be in 'localtrusted' sandbox.

If when the Flash application is opened the following appears: 

    'File sandboxType is localTrusted'
	
everything is set up correctly. Graphs and alerts should be appearing momentarily. If 
something else, like: 

    'File sandbox type is networkTrusted'

appears, the security setttings for the Flash application need to be changed.

To change the security settings:

    - Right click anywhere on the Flash screen
    - Choose 'Settings...'
    - Choose 'Advanced'
    - A new browser window will open up. 
    - Choose 'Global Security Settings Panel' on the left
    - Adobe Flash Settings Manager window will open up.  This is an actual flash
      that controls security settings
    - Choose 'Add location' in the dropdown list
    - Add the location of 'Dash1.swf' file.
    - Refresh browser window and check that the location was saved
    - Close all browser windows and restart the Dash1 Flash application
